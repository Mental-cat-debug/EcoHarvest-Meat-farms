            <h3>CEO Advises Employees Against Product Consumption</h3>
            <p>
                In light of recent developments, the CEO strongly advises all employees against consuming the new product under any circumstances. 
                This precaution is being taken to ensure the safety and well-being of all staff members, as well as to prevent any unintended 
                consequences that may arise from its use. 
            </p>
            <p>
                A recent outbreak of a highly concerning virus has raised serious alarms within the organization. 
                As a result, we are implementing strict safety protocols to mitigate the risk of exposure and contamination. 
                Employees are urged to be vigilant and to take all necessary precautions, including maintaining proper hygiene, 
                wearing protective gear when handling certain materials, and reporting any suspicious symptoms or behaviors immediately.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, we urge all employees to conduct thorough tests on all subjects involved in the production process. 
                A particular point of concern is the presence of the Kuru prion, which has been identified as a major risk factor in 
                recent cases of illness. To prevent further cases from emerging, we ask that all personnel handling subjects remain cautious, 
                ensure all safety checks are followed rigorously, and double-check results before proceeding with production tasks. 
                Our research and development team is actively working on countermeasures, but until a solution is found, 
                we must act with extreme caution to protect both our organization and our consumers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Compliance with these safety guidelines is not optional. Any disregard for these instructions could result in severe consequences, 
                including disciplinary action. We appreciate your cooperation and commitment to maintaining a safe and responsible working environment. 
                Stay informed, stay cautious, and, above all, stay safe.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Company Will No Longer Be Borrowing Subjects for Meat</h3>
            <p>
                Due to increasing complications, including time constraints and heightened police involvement, our company has decided 
                to cease the practice of borrowing subjects for meat acquisition. This decision comes after careful consideration of recent events, 
                which have put our operations at unnecessary risk. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Moving forward, alternative strategies will be implemented to ensure a sustainable and discreet means of securing necessary materials. 
                The executive board has outlined a series of measures aimed at maintaining supply efficiency while reducing external interference. 
                This includes improved sourcing techniques, stricter vetting of supply chains, and the exploration of more discreet collection 
                methods that align with our long-term vision.
            </p>
            <p>
                While this transition may come with initial challenges, we believe it is in the best interest of the company and its continued success. 
                Employees are expected to cooperate fully with these new measures and adapt to the updated protocols accordingly. 
                Additional training sessions will be conducted to ensure all staff are well-equipped to handle these changes effectively. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As always, any questions or concerns regarding this shift in operations should be directed to your department heads. 
                We appreciate your patience and dedication as we move forward with these new strategies.

                Should any individual attempt to withdraw from their duties, speak out against our purpose, or jeopardize the integrity
